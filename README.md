### Accessing Datasets

You can retrieve and analyze each dataset by calling the `read` method with the appropriate symbol:

```python
from indiafactorlibrary import IndiaFactorLibrary

# Initialize the library
ifl = IndiaFactorLibrary()

# Read the Fama-French 4 factors dataset
dataset = ifl.read('ff4')

# Print the dataset description and an example DataFrame
print(dataset['DESCR'])
print(dataset[0].head())
```

The `read` method retrieves a dataset and returns it as a dictionary of DataFrames. Here's a detailed explanation of the output:

```python

}
```

Explanation:
The `DESCR' dataframe shows the titles for the dataframes and their shape. In this case:
0 : Long Short Returns -- Monthly (235 rows x 6 cols)
1 : Annual Factors: January-December (19 rows x 6 cols)

Monthly Returns (0):
Contains monthly returns for the long-short factors: MF, SMB, HML, WML, RF, and MKT.
Indexed by Dates, with each row representing a monthly data point.
Annual Factors (1):
Contains annual returns indexed by Years, with the same factors as above.
Description (DESCR):
A brief textual explanation of the dataset, including methodology references and links to relevant research, where appropriate, and the keys for other dataframes in the dictionary.
Note:
The keys 0 and 1 represent different datasets returned from the same query.
The structure may vary depending on the dataset queried.

### Usage Tips
Accessing DataFrames: Use keys 0 and 1 to access the specific DataFrames directly, for example, in this instance:

```python
monthly_returns = dataset[0]
annual_factors = dataset[1]
```

Viewing Metadata: Access the DESCR field to understand dataset structure and methodology.
